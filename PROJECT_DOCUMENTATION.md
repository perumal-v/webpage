## 6. How to Deploy (Go Live)

This is a **static website**, which makes it free and easy to host. You can use **Netlify**, **Vercel**, **GitHub Pages**, or standard hosting (Hostinger/GoDaddy).

### **Option A: Deploy to Netlify (Recommended - Easiest)**

1.  Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2.  Drag and drop your `dist` folder onto their dashboard.
    - _Note_: To get the `dist` folder, run `npm run build` in your terminal first.
3.  Your site is now live!

### **Option B: Manual Deployment (cPanel / Hostinger)**

1.  **Build the Project**:
    In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a new folder named `dist`. This folder contains the **final, optimized version** of your website.
2.  **Zip the Folder**:
    Compress the contents of the `dist` folder (Index.html, assets folder, etc.) into a ZIP file.
3.  **Upload**:
    Go to your hosting File Manager (public_html folder) and upload the ZIP.
4.  **Extract**:
    Unzip the file. Ensure `index.html` is in the main directory.
